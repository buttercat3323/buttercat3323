## Hi!

My Name is Iaroslav and I'm a student of Computer Science in Brno.

My interests lie particularly in the fields of cybersecurity, computer networks and machine learning.

I'm currently in my last year of bachelor's and working on my thesis.

Aside from IT, I am an avid language learner and an active student inside and outside the university.
